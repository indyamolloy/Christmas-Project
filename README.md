### About the project:
During my time at The School of Code we were asked to create a project independently over the Christmas holiday. I based this project on a personal hobby and to use the skills I learned during the first 5 weeks of the bootcamp. 

I utilized a [public API](https://github.com/ekelen/tarot-api) that provided data on the tarot cards and fetched this data within the project to display random card layouts and a random card picker.
Unfortunately, this API didn't provide images with the cards so these were added seperately. In the future, I would like to build a backend for this project that will allow user readings to be saved to a database.

### Built with:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

### Future Updates:
- [ ]  Search for cards/keywords 
- [ ]  More card layouts to be added
